Music is my main hobby but I like to combine it with my other ones.

# Music, Math, and DIY Electronics

- Playing guitar, bass, and synthesizers (eurorack mainly).

- Making DIY guitar pedals and synthesizers.

- Dabbling in production.

- Collecting records.

I also play Magic: The Gathering competitively. Please contact me if you want to make an AI to play MtG. It's something I've been meaning to do. 

## Here's a couple of fractal wavetables I made.
Try them out in Serum or with an Arturia Mini/Microfreak.
- This [Weirstrass function](https://github.com/rrags/roniloragodos/blob/main/assets/weirstrass_function.wav){:target="_blank"} is continuous but nowhere differentiable. It's supposed to cause an auditory paradox because when played twice as fast it should sound lower to most people.

- This [Takagi curve](https://github.com/rrags/roniloragodos/blob/main/assets/takagi_curve.wav){:target="_blank"} is also a fractal curve, but is better behaved than a Weirstrass function.
