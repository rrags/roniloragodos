Music is my main hobby but I like to combine it with my other ones.

## Music, Math, and DIY Electronics

- Playing guitar, bass, and synthesizers (eurorack mainly).

- Making DIY guitar pedals and synthesizers.

- Dabbling in production.

- Collecting records.

# Here's a couple of fractal wavetables I made.
- This [Weirstrass function](https://github.com/rrags/roniloragodos/blob/main/assets/weirstrass_function.wav){:target="_blank"} causes an auditory paradox because it sounds mostly the same when you play it twice as fast.

- This [Takagi curve](https://github.com/rrags/roniloragodos/blob/main/assets/takagi_curve.wav){:target="_blank"} is also a fractal curve, but is better behaved than a Weirstrass function.
