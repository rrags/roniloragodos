Hi,

I am a PhD student in the Business Analytics department of the [University of Iowa](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/about/business-analytics-department){:target="_blank"}. My PhD advisors are [Dr. Tong Wang](https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/tong-wang){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Nick Street](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/nick-street){:target="_blank"}. 

My research interests generally have to do with interpretable machine learning. I focus on designing novel intrinsically interpretable deep learning models that help solve problems in business and healthcare. Bricolage is my preferred technique for doing research. I especially enjoy applications where I can draw from computer vision and reinforcement learning. 

I previously received a Master's in Mathematics at the University of Iowa and double majored in Computer Science and Applied Math at Texas A&M.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:ronilo-ragodos@uiowa.edu) at ronilo-ragodos@uiowa.edu.
