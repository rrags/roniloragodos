Hi,

I am a PhD student in the Business Analytics department of the [University of Iowa](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/about/business-analytics-department){:target="_blank"}. I previously received a Master's in Mathematics at the University of Iowa and double majored in Computer Science and Applied Math at Texas A&M.

My research interests generally have to do with interpretable machine learning. I leverage interpretable machine learning to solve problems in business and healthcare. I especially enjoy applications where I can use techniques from computer vision and/or reinforcement learning.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:rragodos@uiowa.edu).
